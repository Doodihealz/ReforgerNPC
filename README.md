## Reforger NPC (Eluna / AzerothCore)

A reforging NPC that applies **two random enchantments** to an equipped item. It uses a custom tier-based enchantment system to determine what's eligible at various player levels, and supports both armor and weapon enchantments ‚Äî including support for Shaman imbues, poisons, and rare effects like Windfury or Mongoose.

### üíæ Installation

1. Run `Reforger.sql` on your world database to create the reforging NPC.
2. Run `item_enchantment_random_tiers.sql` to install the tiered enchantment definitions.
3. Place `Reforger.lua` inside your server's `lua_scripts/` directory.

### üîß How It Works

When interacting with the NPC, the script lets the player select an eligible equipped item. That item is deleted, re-created with 2 random enchantments, and then re-equipped. Because of this, **socketed gems will be lost**, suffixes like ‚Äúof the Bear‚Äù may change, and temporary effects like poisons or imbues may be overridden.

Each item has two enchant slots:
- **Slot 1** is for normal enchants (+10 Stats, Crusader, etc.)
- **Slot 2** is for temp effects (Windfury, poisons, etc.)

Example:  
`Slot 1: +14 Agility`  
`Slot 2: +8 Stamina`  
Casting Flametongue would override +8 Stamina.  
Adding +10 Stats would override +14 Agility.

### üìä Enchantment Tier System

The `item_enchantment_random_tiers` table defines the tiers. The script uses your character level to determine the **highest eligible tier**:
- Tier 1 = Level 1+
- Tier 2 = Level 30+
- Tier 3 = Level 60+
- Tier 4 = Level 70+
- Tier 5 = Level 80+

Items are only eligible for enchantments of their class (WEAPON, ARMOR, or ANY). Weapon enchantments (like Windfury or Mongoose) are slightly favored when reforging weapons (10% increased chance), but they **can** still be missed for variety.

All enchantments are pulled from your SQL data. Weapon enchants like Windfury 2 are tagged as WEAPON and tier 3 ‚Äî meaning they only become available at level 60+ and only apply to weapons.

**Duplicate enchantments will never be applied** (e.g., you will not get Windfury 3 twice on the same item). Two similar but distinct enchants (like +43 Spell Power and +44 Spell Power) are allowed on the same item.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional Notes

- **Ranged Attack Power** enchants are only applied if the player is a **Hunter** (class ID 4).
- Items with suffix stats (e.g., ‚Äúof the Monkey‚Äù) will reroll randomly after reforging.

### üõ† Customization

- Edit gold cost per item quality inside `Reforger.lua` (`QUALITY_COST` table).
- Adjust NPC ID or excluded item list freely.
